Abstract:

We aimed to apply machine learning to predict whether a gene is involved in axon regeneration. We
extracted 31 features from different databases and trained five machine learning models. Our optimal
model, a Random Forest Classifier with 50 sub-models, yielded a test score of 85.71%, which is 4.1%
higher than the baseline score. We concluded that our models have some predictive capability. Similar
methodology and features could be applied to predict other Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
